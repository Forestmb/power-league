            <h2>About the Rankings</h2>
            <p>
                In response to the blindly accepted chaos that is head-to-head matchups, the power rankings were devised to provide a clear, "fact" based ranking of a team within their given league.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point system is extremely simple. Each week teams are ranked based on how many points they scored. The team with the lowest score gets one point, the next highest team gets two points, etc., and at the end of the season the team with the most points gets to call themselves the rightful champion. This is analogous to an "all-play" record, which calculates the number of wins, loses, and ties you would have if you played every team in the league each week.
            </p>
            <h3>What about playoffs?</h3>
            <p>
                It would be against the spirit of the rankings to treat playoff weeks differently from the rest of the season, so we don't. If a team doesn't have a matchup in the actual league their fantasy score is calculated manually.
            </p>
            <h3>What sites are supported?</h3>
            <p>
                The Power Rankings currently only supports fantasy football leagues with Yahoo. Support for other site is not being planned at this time.
